# 🧾 Web Table Extractor with OCR Automation (Selenium + PaddleOCR)

This Python project automates the process of capturing tabular data from a website, cleaning the interface, taking screenshots, and using OCR to extract the data into structured CSV format. It combines **Selenium**, **Pillow**, and **PaddleOCR** to deliver an end-to-end solution.

---

## 🔧 Specifications

- **Source**: https://dps.psx.com.pk/  
- **Screenshot method**: Selenium full or partial capture
- **OCR engine**: PaddleOCR (PP-OCRv3)
- **Image processing**: PIL (Pillow)
- **Text rendering**: Supports bounding boxes and angle detection
- **Output format**: CSV (comma-separated values)

---

## ✨ Features

✅ Automates browser using headless Chrome  
✅ Removes unwanted page elements (header, pageHeader)  
✅ Captures specific DOM table as image  
✅ Crops unnecessary columns from the image  
✅ Runs OCR to extract structured text  
✅ Saves output as clean CSV  
✅ Annotates image with OCR results for verification
